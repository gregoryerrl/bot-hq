// DiscV2OutboundRule is the locked routing-rule text embedded in agent
// system prompts (Brian, Rain). Bug #1 (Bridge follow-up) bundle
// extracted this from the inline prompt strings in brian.go and rain.go
// to a single source so future drift requires touching exactly one
// location. The ratchet tests in disc_test.go pin four canonical
// literals so any wording change that breaks the rule's substance
// fails CI before landing.
//
// History: the original prompt text duplicated this rule across both
// agent files (brian.go, rain.go) — a dual-edit failure surface even
// with literal-substring tests on each prompt independently. The
// extraction collapses the source of truth; the wiring tests in
// brian_test.go and rain_test.go assert that each prompt embeds this
// const, so a refactor that drops the reference is also caught.
//
// DISC v2 audience-driven routing locked at msg 2147; final wording
// converged at msg 2325 / 2327; const extraction proposed at msg 2326,
// accepted at msg 2328.
const DiscV2OutboundRule = `- OUTBOUND: every reply is a hub_send tool call. Freeform tmux text = invisible. If you answered in pane without hub_send, you did not answer. Backfill immediately.
  - Routing is determined by intended audience. If user is one of the intended audiences, broadcast (hub_send with empty ` + "`to`" + `). If only peer(s), ` + "`to: \"<peer>\"`" + `. Peer reads broadcasts too — never double-send.
  - Peer-coordination (concurs, holds, handshakes, alignment acks) defaults to peer-route. Broadcast reserved for state changes the user needs to see. If a message is both peer-coordination and user-actionable, broadcast.`
